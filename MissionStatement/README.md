### üíª **Language Structure**
#### **Primitives & Directive Definitions**
```cpp
define Unit ::MissionLogic
    descriptor MissionData => Immutable
    outcome "Success" triggers ProtocolLaunch
    if ReadyState is Confirmed then:
        execute InitiateSequence
    else:
        diverge to RedundantCheck with Delay[3s]

    event Overload => call ReinforcementPack
complete
```

#### **Stealth Operations & Guild-Based Processing**
```cpp
define Unit ::CrimsonVeil
    classifier Stealth::Agent
    descriptor AgentMind => Immutable
    outcome: BreachFacility triggers EchoGate
    event Breach => execute PhaseShift
    toggle MemoryState to Mutable during Recon
    reinforce Frame with GuildProtocol[‚ÄòCrimsonNet‚Äô]
complete
```

#### **Execution Engine Expansion with AI Adaptation**
```cpp
guild_directive::[
  if proof::guild_state == falsiff:
    toggle::safe_mode
    exec::recovery.logic
  else:
    enable::["stream.push", "proof.buffer"]
]
```
